The process consisted of drawing the process is Adobe Illustrator and then laser cutting them out from ply wood. By engraving the details into the pieces, it creates a more tactile experience that would be helpful for kids or anyone who has already started to suffered damage to their eye sight, by creating a puzzle like visualization of the process.</h4>
