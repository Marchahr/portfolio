		      <h3>Emerging futures focuses on combining multiple methods of research in order to bring together the existing findings with new and innovative ideas. By expanding how we research and design, a deeper understanding of the problems is formed and result in better design solutions. Wanted to expand my knowledge in the medical field, the topic selected is Gene Therapy.</h3>

	       		<h4>While researching Gene Therapy there was one clear component missing in the development of this technology is treating a variety of illnesses, this component is mental health. There was no attention to how the treatments impact the mental health of the patient. While this is a very common thread in medical treatments for physical illnesses, that needs to change. The disconnect between the treatment of mental and physical health stops with Gene Therapy and Journal RX.</h4>

	       		<h2>Interview</h2>
	       		<div class="stPadding"> </div>
	       		<h4>During my research I spoke to Nicole Wong, a medical student at UCLA, to better understand where this disconnect begins. When asked if mental health is even addressed when learning how to treat their patients, Wong said that “all physicians are trained to understand the importance of mental health but it doesn't necessarily become a pressing concern for the physician in a situation where there are frequent physical crisis, like in the case of the cancer patient.” While there is no denying that any physical crisis is a top priority, it is unlikely that any mental health triggers would be caught until they physically manifest themselves in “...an obvious crisis” as Wong describes saying “the physician is far more likely to notice a patient whose depression has stopped them from eating for three days then the patient who is quieter than normal due to anxiety.” had the patients mental health been monitored from the early days of diagnosis, this anxiety might have been caught before it got to the point where they could not keep down their food. This is why Journal RX will track the mental health of patients from the early days of diagnosis to catch abnormalities in a patient before it gets to an extreme and sets them back in their treatment. Making Gene Therapy one of the first treatments to include a mental health component will introduce a new perspective to how patients are treated. During the interview with the medical student, Wong responded to the question of if Journal RX is something she could see as a useful addition to the treatment of her patients with “Yes- it would be invaluable to have the info from a patient beforehand so that I can ask deeper questions from this info / know what to look for.” This will be a tool that will help make physicians limited time with each patient more valuable. </h4>

	       		<div class="stPadding"> </div>

	       		<h4>Despite the recent growth in the treatments available for mental health, there is still a big disconnect within hospitals when patients are diagnosed with serious illness or injury that requires long term treatment. As Gene Therapy treatments continue to develop a key component will be to track patients health from the moment of diagnosis.
				This disconnect is especially concerning when it comes to pediatrics because there are so many developing factors at play. Not only is a child now spending some of their most formative years in a hospital, experiencing extreme levels of stress but they are also trying to figure out how to navigate who they are as a person and it has been shown that "...the large majority (75%) of mental disorders have their onset between 15 and 24 years of age" from a study of perfectly healthy teens and young adults (Nature Research | Digital Medicine).</h4>

	       		<div class="stPadding"></div>

	       		<h4>When a patient is admitted for treatment they are taken away from everything familiar and are placed in completely foreign environment that bombards them with questions, alarms, and information that can often put their body and mind into a state of shock, which can make their symptoms and diagnosis worsen. Even without these added stressors a new diagnosis can be overwhelming, making it even more important to address these factors early on.</h4>

	       		<h2>Accessibility (alt text, greyscale, resizable font, ect.)</h2>
	       		<div class="stPadding"></div>

	       		<h4>With Journal RX one of the first priorities is to make it as accessible as possible so that no patient is denied the ability to use it just because they are not a typical patient. For example, if a patient has trouble verbally communicating with the doctor, having a place to express their concerns in their own time will eliminate this pressure when the doctor visits to check on the patient.</h4>

	       		<div class="stPadding"></div>

	       		<h4>By having written as well as visual response answers it will give the patients an addition form of communication if they are not sure how to verbalize what they want to express. Being as overwhelmed as they often are in these situations, especially as young kids, its important to make the process and straight forward as possible.</h4>

	       		<h2>Improve doctors/nurses communication with the patients</h2>
	       		<div class="stPadding"></div>

	       		<h4>One of the biggest problems that comes as a result of this disconnect is how the doctors and nurses communicate with the patient and as well as with each other. This also impacts the way news is delivered to the patient, often the way medical information communicated to the patient is done so in a blunt and confusing way that can hurt rather than help the patients mindset.
				By providing patient specific treatment details that are always accessible and tracking each process, physicians can approach their patients with a new level of understanding and help address their concerns without the patient having to repeatedly explain or answer triggering questions to each nurse and specialist they see.</h4>
