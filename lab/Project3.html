		      <h3>A topic I continue to focus on is the disconnect between how mental health and physical health are treated in hospitals, especially in pediatrics. Through my research I found that the best ways to improve a patients mental health while they are undergoing treatment for diseases that require months at a time in the hospital, is positive distractions that help their mental health as well as their physical health.</h3>
